## About Me #
Sophie Schnaper is a 26 year old Digital Strategy graduate student at the University of Florida. Originally from Orlando, Sophie moved to South Florida when she graduated college and currently lives in Fort Lauderdale. Previously, she earned her Bachelor's and Master's in Elementary Education and taught upper-elementary for 3 years. The challenges of teaching during a pandemic were the catalyst for Sophie to leave teaching and pursue digital marketing and foster her love of graphic design and interest in coding. 

## Past Coding Experience ##
Sophie's previous coding experience is nonexistent. She used educational platforms to teach her students to code, but it was very basic and essentially introduced the idea of programming. However, YouTube is a great resource and Sophie is sure that she will learn to code in no time!

## Career Goals ##
1. In the short-term, I'd like to secure a full-time digital marketign position.
2. In the next five years, I hope to work for a marketing or advertising agency as an account executive, collaborating with others to plan and execute national and international campaigns.
